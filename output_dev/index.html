            <p>I sent the following email to the CEO of Northern Rail this morning after over a month of frustrating commutes to work.</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>

<p>I’ve recently moved to Swinton in Manchester and I knew in advance that the area was serviced by Northern Rail so my expectations were lower than what I was used to on First Transpennine I wasn’t quite expecting it to be this bad. Here are the examples of things that have happened in the 1 and a half months since i moved:</p>

<ol>
<li>Average daily delay is 10-15 minutes. Mostly in a morning. Me and my partner have come to terms with the fact that the train just won’t be there at the time it says.</li>
<li>Overcrowding, these are busy services I accept this at peak times but not being able to get on the train is not acceptable. One morning I saw a train guard get stuck in the doors as they were closing, it looked painful.</li>
<li>No drivers. This confuses me, how can there be no driver for a train? Sure everyone is human and things go wrong but are there no spare drivers? My offer of driving it myself was turned down though, I suspect this was because I’m a developer.</li>
<li>Train going down the wrong line… let me repeat that train… going… down… the… wrong… line! I didn’t know this was possible. Luckily there wasn’t a collision and we were just delayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is over a small period of time. It’s frustrating beyond belief I want to get to work so I can do my job. If I create bad code then I’m responsible and have to act on it.</p>

<p>Will Northern Rail be improving the service? We need more reliable services, more trains to ease overcrowding and a better service overall.</p>

<p>Regards,
Mike Bell</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I'm tired, I'm exhausted. I'm mentally fucked.</p>

<p>I had my first "official" appraisal today and I still can't shake the feeling that I've fucked up. That I'm not good enough and everything is my fault.</p>

<p>I'm not even sure it is but at the moment I just feel like I should crawl into a ball and forgot that I exist.</p>

<p>There's one part of the appraisal that has really shocked and upset me. Dependability. My "dependability" is less than satisfactory or some other equally negative wording. I don't really know what to say about that. I feel like I've failed totally. I hope that my friends don't think that.</p>

<p>I'm putting up a front, that I'm fine. The front is breaking and the cracks are showing.</p>

<p>I'm acutely aware of how risky it is putting stuff like this out there. I'm worried that I'll be pulled up at work for things I say here. I'm worried that it'll effect my future employability. I live this half life where I'm constantly worried I'll hurt people and myself yet can pass as a normal human being. I'm sat here watching Hannah clean because we have guests tomorrow and I want to cry. I don't want to hurt those I love. I want to get better but today just seems like a lost cause.</p>
