        </header>

            <p><strong><em>The following was written and unedited on 13th March 2013 the day after my Grandma died.</em></strong></p>

<p>Death is never an easy subject to tackle, it's something that everyone must face in their own time. Whether it be a close relative or friend death happens and you can't avoid that.</p>

<p>What perplexes me is why death is such a taboo subject, gone are the days when the thought of it used to paralyze me with fear.</p>

<p>Yesterday my grandma passed away and I'm happy, yes happy. She was in a lot of pain and she wasn't the person I knew her to be. I subscribe to no major religions but I like to think she's in a better place now whatever that may be.</p>

<p>The majority of my granparents are now gone, none have passed in nice ways. All have suffered in some way, lately it seems more horrific. I'm a firm believer in Euthanasia, there comes a point when people just want to pass on. I don't understand why it's not possible to help your loved ones do this in the UK.</p>

<p><strong><em>The following was written on the 27th March nearly a week after the funeral.</em></strong></p>

<p>I considered deleting the above as understandably I was emotional, however I feel it's still relevant.</p>

<p>I remember my Grandpa being ready even when cancer had robbed him of his former glory. I remember shaking his hand and him saying how proud he was of me and I left the room never to see him again. I remember how frail he looked. That is a memory I wish I didn't have, it over shadows the other good memories.</p>

<p>While my parents and family were sorting out my grandparents house my uncle found a book on perfumery and asked to pass it on to me, these are the memories I want to have of my grandparents.</p>

<p>My thoughts on Euthanasia will not change and while it's not always applicable I find it quite sad that the UK treats people as criminals when they're helping with their relatives last wishes.</p>

<p>I hope to live to see the day when it's no longer a crime and people are given the right to assisted suicide.</p>

<p>I don't have a living will (yet) but I've spoken to my Dad about the death and my plans should anything happen to me. We both have a mutual understanding of what has to be done.</p>
