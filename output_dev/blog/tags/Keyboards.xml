            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I bought a Pure Pro I've sort of been obsessed with the world of mechanical keyboards. As a developer I want to make sure I'm happy typing on something day in day out. It's also very important that I can type fast and accurate so I have to be 100% happy with a keyboard. I've recently sold my Pure Pro which I was pretty happy with as it's just not for me. I bought a Poker 2 ANSI (American layout) as a temporary replacement to it which I've been more than happy with. It currently has <a href="https://ctrlalt.io/buys/raindrop-r2">Raindrop</a> keys on and a Tex acrylic case, it's the nicest keyboard I've ever had the pleasure of typing on.</p>

<p>I've become quite interested in building my own custom keyboard based off the Poker 2 since ISO versions are very very rare these days. I came up with the following layout:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The Drop Layout - can&#39;t wait to build this in a couple of months: <a href="http://t.co/bfjqaTU3CO">pic.twitter.com/bfjqaTU3CO</a></p>&mdash; Mike Bell (@mikebell_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebell_/status/524943339297439745">October 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For the board I've looked into 4 different possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>GH60 - marred by controversy and lack of delivery</li>
<li>Print my own GH60 - only Rev 3 is out and it has a bug so that's a no go</li>
<li>Custom wiring + Teensy 2 - I don't have the skill to pull this off</li>
<li>Nerd60 - pre-soldiered, leds, just add switches!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-nerd-60">The Nerd 60</h1>

<p>I've settled on this PCB as it supports both backlight and side LEDs which will look cool with my Tex case, I just need to wait for it to arrive from Korea when the MOQ has been met.</p>

<p>The controller itself is fully re-programmable and supports lots of different programming layers which is really cool.</p>

<h1 id="the-layout-itself">The layout itself</h1>

<p>I really like 60% keyboards, they're easy to transports and have everything I need to develop on. They fall down with the placement of keys and utilities. That's why I designed this layout.</p>

<p>Here are some key features:
* No Caps lock key, instead it's replaced with an additional Fn key for easy access with your little finger.
* WASD arrow keys, easier access with Caps Fn key.
* Media keys on left hand
* Sane config of utility keys accessible via single right hand or left hand Fn and right hand.
* Mac Layout-ish</p>

<p>I'll be doing a full build log with pictures once I get started, there are still a few decisions I have to make with the keyboard but those are still a way off.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve gone a bit mad on keyboards recently, mostly due to <a href="http://geekhack.org/">geekhack</a> and <a href="www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">r/mechanicalkeyboards</a>. I’ve got the following boards at the moment:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00FBCYAKI/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00FBCYAKI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mikebellio-21">Ducky Shine 3 - ISO - Brown switches</a> -
This is a 75% keyboard, it’s missing the number pad on the right side. It’s a great gaming keyboard and the keys feel nice and solid. This has white led backlighting which is quite nice, mines currently setup to pulse when a key is pressed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00A2LLJ0W/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00A2LLJ0W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mikebellio-21">KBT Pure Pro - ISO - Brown switches</a> -
A 60% board with built in arrow keys, it’s an ok board but it’s not standard key sizes on the right hand side of the board make it a pain to get used to. Like the Ducky this has white backlight which can get really bright, no fancy display modes though.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00GERK25G/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00GERK25G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mikebellio-21">Poker 2 - ANSI - Brown switches</a> -
Another 60% board without the physical arrow keys which means the keys have a much better layout and size. It has white thick PBT caps which make for a nice feel and quietens the keyboard down a bit as well. It doesn’t have any led lights (apart from caps lock) but you can easily fit those as a mod.</p>

<p>Each one has it’s pros and cons. I use the Ducky at home for gaming and the Poker 2 at work for coding.</p>

<p>I’m currently waiting on shipment of some LEDs for the Poker 2 and a new set of <a href="http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=52475.0">Raindrop</a> key caps although I’m not sure which keyboard they’ll be going on yet, part of me wants to spray the Ducky white so it fits with the colour scheme.</p>

<p>After modding my Poker 2 with LEDs I’m going to make a GH60 which is another 60% keyboard but with multiple programmable layers and support for any layout you can think of.</p>
