            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very short session clocking in at 30 minutes over the phone.</p>

<p>I can see what we're trying to achieve through CBT but it just seems a bit pointless, I don't think we really covered much of importance. I much prefer in person sessions as I can't distract myself or become distracted by other things as easily.</p>

<p>I don't really have much to report on this session, in the next sessions we'll be covering breathing techniques to help bring my anxiety down and help control panic attacks more.</p>

<p>I'd be interested to see what other people's CBT session structure is like as like most people I'm going into this blindly.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had my second round of CBT today and it went much better than the first round. This time I took a bottle of water with me it gave me something to focus on and stop my hands from getting all weird, it's also amazing how thirsty you get during these things.</p>

<p>The session was focused on a few situations over the past few weeks where I've had issues with anxiety and panic attacks. We identified things about the situations and how I should be dealing with them.</p>

<p>I feel much more positive after today's session and I'm glad that I'm sticking with it, I can see that this will help me and provide me with the tools to help control my thoughts better.</p>
