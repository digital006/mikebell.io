<p>I seem to have been all over the place today. Didn't really get chance to focus on something for more than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Went to nwdug though and I remember why it's such an important part of the Manchester Drupal scene.</p>

<p>Just couldn't seem to get into today at all. Didn't help that I had no appetite all day and only had porridge for lunch. Coffee did nothing to help me at all.</p>

<p>Pretty much everything I worked on today was one of those problems where the only solution was to just start all over again.</p>

<p>I find it really tough to be positive sometimes.</p>

<p>Pretty good day overall, stayed calm regardless of what's going on.</p>

<p>Prepping for my presentation on Wednesday which is actually pretty cool. Added a stupid feature to drush-docset so I can demonstrate it.</p>

<p>The International is on as well so that's keeping me happy!</p>

<p>Woke up next to Hannah and she was smiling, that's a very nice way to start the day. Really looking forward into our house.</p>

<p>I'm still shattered from London but I'm coming round.</p>

<p>No negative thoughts today which is pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Still so tired from London. Had a relaxing morning and afternoon though.</p>

<p>Hannah came over in the evening and we went for food and drinks which was great. Always feel positive when she's around.</p>

<p>I'm so tired. London really kills me. It doesn't help that my train was cancelled for the second time in a row.</p>

<p>I don't really have much to say today, the only real positive was that I got to work on some static site search research and look into twig a bit more.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Status: Fail</p>

<p>Overall I think today was worse but I can't put my finger on why, maybe I just wasn't trying hard enough.</p>

<p>I think that various stresses throughout the day didn't help.</p>

<p>Games night was great though, I had so much fun playing Munchkin and just relaxing with friends.</p>

<p>Here's to tomorrow!</p>

<p>Today was the first day of Operation Positive. The challenge is to not to be negative in the aim of changing how I think.</p>

<p>It was a failure but that was to be expected and not a huge problem. Below are things from the day that are note worthy:</p>

<ul>
<li>I ran the internal retrospective there were negative things on there. Way more positive things though!</li>
<li>Many meetings, my default state is all meetings are bad even if they aren't.</li>
<li>Struggling to feel like I'm doing a good job.</li>
<li>Staying positive is hard and tiring.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll try and blog everyday on how things are going. It should be interesting to see how forcing myself to be positive works out. I'm also want to write more about my daily work and how it makes me feel but it's always difficult to word things so people don't panic, so we'll see how that goes.</p>
