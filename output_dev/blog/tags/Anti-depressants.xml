            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I fucked up and I fucked up badly.</p>

<p>A few months ago I went cold turkey on propranolol (against all feedback) and after a few weeks the side effects went away and I was fine.</p>

<p>A week ago I decided to stop taking Citalopram cold turkey. This was not a good idea.</p>

<p>Currently I'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms, they're not very nice and they make working and life very difficult.</p>

<p>My symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hazy head</li>
<li>Extreme emotions</li>
<li>Quick to anger</li>
<li>Tension headaches</li>
</ul>

<p>I've learnt my lesson and I'm going back up to 20mg and will sort out tapering off properly.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Today I'm feeling better after going back on them, still a bit hazy and my head aches but I'm a lot better. Don't fuck around with SSRIs</p>
