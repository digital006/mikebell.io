            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back when I was a young kid I remember being influenced by so much music. My Dad with heavy rock from the 70/80s, my mum with Elton John and random Christian based music. Stand out album from this period has to be:</p>

<p>The Waterboys - Fishermans Blues - Stand out track has to be "We Will Not Be Lovers", to this day I love this track. I was recently reminded of this while watching Dom Hemingway, Doms daughter covers "Fishermans Blues" quite well.</p>

<p>As a grew up I found the sounds of electronic music. I remember buying so many Euphoria CDs and listening to them non stop. Electronic music specifically trance and house represented a feeling that was totally new in my musical history.</p>

<p>My teenage music tastes varied widely, from electronic music I found myself listening to more and more emo/screamo. I remember a friend in secondary school lending me a Limp Bizkit album which was pretty good for the time. I then moved on to Linkin Park, Hybrid Theory was pretty much a well rinsed album during that period of my life. I also moved on to Metallica and their earlier stuff. I coveted Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning as must have albums.</p>

<p>When I went to university my tastes altered towards Deftones, I remember falling asleep to their self titled album after many a drunken night out. Deftones will always have a special place in my heart for all their amazing music. I was also massively into Alexisonfire, I dragged my brother to a gig of theirs in Leeds and remember watching one of the band members constantly snorting white snot out of his nose while the entire place moshed out.</p>

<p>In what can only be classified as my working years I've found a home in more electronic music, I started listening to more trance again and from there moved solidly into Drum and Bass.</p>

<p>Now I've come to appreciate all types of music, I'm currently listening to Burial. I tend to listen to quite a wide range of music and realise now how much it's shaped who I am.</p>
