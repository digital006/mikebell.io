            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Friday the 22nd there will be sprints at Techhub which run in parallel with the business day at Drupal Camp NW 13. I'm hoping to be there for the sprints pending confirmation of my holiday!</p>

<p>After the sprints/business day it makes sense for everyone to get together and go grab some food and drinks. Since everyone will be around the northern quarter we should make the most of it.</p>

<p>For food/drinks we'll head to A Place Called Common, they serve great burgers and have food suitable for vegetarians (not sure about vegan).</p>

<p>If your not fussed about drinking then next door there is Home Sweet Home which serves a great Pulled Pork and Sweet Potato bowl.</p>

<p>After food and a few drinks we can move on to Odd Bar / Trof / Marble Beer House or head the other way to Port Street Beer House / Whisky Jar / Kosmonoaut (also does food but gets really busy). This is up to you guys, they're all great bars but offer different things.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the Manchester Christmas markets will be open which is always good as long as it's not raining (can't promise anything!). The Albert Square (town hall) markets are open till 9pm, they'll be busy but they offer a great atmosphere and come with beer and food.</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments if anyone has any preferences or would like suggestions for anything. Here's a map of some of the venues - http://eatmanc.mikebell.io/</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For me the the Drupal community is amazing, it's always felt like a family, one you can rely on to help and support you.</p>

<p>It's time for a call to arms, people need to support their local and regional Drupal user groups and events. A lot of these events are volunteer run, it takes time and energy to run meetup after meetup and big events. The people that organise and run these events are quite something, 9 to 5 days don't exist for them.</p>

<p>So this is where you come in, it's easy to help out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Volunteering - everyone needs volunteers, get in touch with your local usergroup or next camp and see if they need your help.</li>
<li>Sponsorship - camps aren't free, they cost money and no one likes to talk about it. If your a company or individual then please consider sponsoring your local camp/meetup. It gets your name out there and some extra brownie points within the community.</li>
<li>Spreading the word - advertise your local camp/meetup, tell your friends and colleagues, blog and tweet about it. It all helps.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm lucky to have worked with some great people on both NWDUG (North West Drupal User Group) and DrupalCamp NW 12 so I know how much the smallest of contribution can help.</p>

<p>If your in the UK and looking to support your local or regional group then take a look at DrupalCamp NW 2013 - http://camp2013.nwdrupal.org.uk/ - they're looking for sponsors and volunteers.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's no easy way to put this but as of this post I'm withdrawing from organising DrupalCamp NW 2013.</p>

<p>A lot of things have changed over the past 4 months some good some not so. I intend to spend as much time with my friends and family and avoid the stress of organising the event.</p>

<p>Where does this leave the event? Pretty much in the same place as it was a few months ago, I'd love for more people to step up and take charge of the event. Nothing would make me happier than attending DCNW 2013 as an attendee for a change! Hell I might actually see some sessions.</p>

<p>If you would like to get involved then please come along to the next NWDUG (7pm 1st May at Madlab) or get in touch with either me or Phil Norton.</p>

            <id>/blog/2013/03/30/we-went-big</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is hopefully going to be the one of the first of many posts going through the motions of organising DrupalCamp NW 2013 or project "WTF are you doing???"</em></p>

<p>The full title of this post is "We went big, now to go bigger". What do I mean by this? Well for start 2012 was amazing the fact that we managed to pull it off and provide such a great event means that we have a lot of work to do. So what next? Well...</p>

<ol>
<li>Money - no one likes to talk about it, but these things don't come free or cheap!</li>
<li>Venue - this is a tough one, we had a great first venue but if we want to go bigger then...</li>
<li>Speakers - our quality it 2012 was amazing we need to equal this and go beyond.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="money">Money</h2>

<p>To get money we need sponsors, 2012s sponsors were great! I mean really great, they made things super easy and gave us the capital to create what we did.</p>

<p>How are we going to manage it for 2013, to be honest pretty much the same way, the major difference is that all tickets will be handled through Eventbrite rather than through Ubercart.</p>

<h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>

<p>We have some big decisions to make, if we want to go bigger then we're going to have to look elsewhere. The University of Salford had a max capacity of 150, now this might sound like a lot but you can guarantee that even if you sell out your not going to get that amount turning up, it sucks but that's the way these things go.</p>

<p>So where else can we go, well we're currently looking at a few potential venues and hopefully we can pull something together.</p>

<p>By no means have we discounted UoS! But there's no harm in looking around.</p>

<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>

<p>This goes without saying that 2012 had a tough act to follow, this year we'll be extending invitations out for people to come keynote as well as do special sessions. As per usual we will be opening up community submissions which will go through the same voting process as last year (more to come in a post later).</p>

<p>I hope this post is enough to wet your appetite on what's to come in the next few months!</p>
