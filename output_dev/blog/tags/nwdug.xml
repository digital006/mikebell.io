            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of the 6th February I’ve stepped down from NWDUG it’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a while now and I now have other things that need my focus. Phil Norton is a great person to work with and I hope that whoever steps up to help will have as much fun as I have over the past few years.</p>

<p>So whats next? Well I intend to ramp up my involvement with Code Club Manchester, it’s something that I believe in strongly and think I can make a great start with it. I’ll still be running Drupal Sprints Manchester (follow at http://twitter.com/drupalsprints) but the format will be different and new rules will be put into place.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm proud to announce Drupal Sprints Manchester (UK). Last year at Drupal Camp NW I spoke with various other northern Drupalers and decided that we should get together and attempt to emulate Drupal Sprints London.</p>

<p>The format is simple, Drupal developers / themers / builders get to together and work on Drupal core and contrib.</p>

<p>My aim is to provide a space where people can get together and get stuck in working on Drupal and giving back to the community in the form of code, all that's required is a laptop with an development stack and your brain.</p>

<p>The first meetup will be held on the 26th October at Techhub in Manchester more details can be found here - http://www.meetup.com/nwdrupal/events/142003462/</p>

<p>If you intend on coming then please sign up so we have a good idea of the numbers.</p>

<p>Please help spread the word!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those that don't know me I hate HTML and CSS odd considering the profession I'm in.</p>

<p>I love when I see people do cool presentations and I really like to know how they've done it. Maybe I'm just a closet themer waiting to get out? Nah.</p>

<p>After watching <a href="https://twitter.com/MartianWebDev">Andrew MacPherson</a> at <a href="http://nwdrupal.org.uk/">nwdug</a> this week I was really impressed with Reavel.js so figured I'd give it a go for my presentation next week at <a href="http://drupalyorkshire.org.uk/">Drupal Yorkshire</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reveal.js">Reveal.js</h2>

<p><a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">Reveal.js</a> is a javascript framework for creating really nice looking presentations quick and easily. It uses some HTML5 stuff mixed in with some nice CSS3/SASS magic.</p>

<p>Reveal comes with a few nice themes (including solarized dark which is actually called moon for some reason). Syntax highlighting seems a bit broken on my version though.</p>

<h2 id="zen-coding">Zen Coding</h2>

<p>I recently found <a href="https://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/">Zen Coding</a> by looking through the list of plugins in PHPStorm. It's a really nice way of writing html in short hand:
<code>section>h1.header+p+ul*2</code></p>

<p>turns into:</p>

<p><code class="xml"></p>

<section>
     <h1 class="header"></h1>
     <p></p>
     <ul>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
     </ul>
</section>

<p></code></p>

<p>The really clean syntax means that you can easily create skeleton HTML code for layouts. If you couple this with bootstrap then it's even more powerful for prototyping sites.</p>

<p>Overall I'm really happy with the results of my presentation, I'll upload them after next week.</p>
