            <h2><a href="/blog/2010/09/30/panic-coding">Panic Coding</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>What started out as an amusing joke at work one day has turned into quite an interesting concept. After mentioning it to my colleagues and developer friends on IRC this seemed to snowball into some kind of monster.</p>

<p>This is Panic Coding.</p>

<p>This idea is simple, you have a development environment with your current project, nothing else, the bare minimum to work on that project/issue. You then have an hour to fix it. At the end of this hour your development environment is wiped clean. If you've not completed it then tough luck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So how does this work then, the main principle behind the idea is KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). If you can't accomplish the whole or part (OO anyone?) within the hour then something isn't right.</p>

<p>&quot;But what if your project/issue takes longer than an hour?&quot; - <strong>great </strong>question! You can attack this from a few different points.<br />1. Can the problem be broken down? If so why don't two/three/four developers tackle it?<br />2. Are you sure you've gone about things the right way? Is the code horrible? Does it make you cringe? The hour limit means that you really have to think about what your doing.<br />3. You'll simply have to remember the code. Hopefully you should know it already but sometimes google/stackoverflow just gives you the perfect solution, having to remember it will hopefully force you to think about it more. You never know you might learn something.</p>

<p>&quot;What a waste of time!&quot; - uhuh, &quot;Why spend a few hours fixing something when you can put a fix out in two minutes?&quot; - Fair point, if I solve the problem and then it causes another problem I'll be more than happy to bill you for additional time fixing the fix. I can't count the amount of times I've had to fix other peoples &quot;fixes&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm sure there are many more questions and by no means is this a tried and tested method, at the end of the day it's a stupid idea that *<strong>just</strong>* might work.<br />&nbsp;</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I think the dust has settled form Drupalcon CPH, at least my hangover is now well and truly gone (although probably never forgotten, damned Awesomesauce!)</p>

<p>Overall it was a great experience got to meet lots of really cool people both from the drupal community and form #drupaluk. I've seen quite a few blog posts rounding up Drupalcon so figured I might as well write my own but rather than comment on the rather stupid ... wait for it .... here it comes ... queue the DUM DUM DUUUUUUU Sex Scandal I figured I'd talk about the swag.</p>

<p>This was my first outing to a major conference so I have no other benchmarks but I don't think I did too badly:</p>

<p>1. Bucket load of stickers! Probably around 30-40, my favourite being the Kitten Killers.<br />2. Open Publishing T-Shirt, not bad quality, the design is ok as well.<br />3. Rack Hosting T-Shirt, same as above really, not sure about the design though, perfect painting tee.<br />4. VPS.NET stress robot, copy much???<br />5. Drupal Gardens grow-your-own thingy, I've given this to my mum as pretty much every attempt I've ever made at growing something has ended in disaster.<br />6. Random notebook, nope not the electronic kind the paper kind. This is the 21st Century people.</p>

<p>And last but not least probably the best swag I think you could ever get was a VPS. Yes a whole VPS. No strings attached just a free VPS for a year. I was a bit wary about it at first but it seems legit, full root, 512mb of RAM, 10gb HDD, 100gb BW.</p>

<p>I'm still deciding on what to do with mine, so far I've attempted the Omega8cc aegir/nginx install but not had much luck with that. Will probably end up putting regular aegir on and then installing pirc and znc.</p>

<p>So that's about it really, good times had by all plenty of learning was done, plenty of drinking too.<br />&nbsp;</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I figured I'd write this as a reference for an IRC channel I op as quit a few people wonder how to Scrobble from an iPod Classic.  </p>

<p>You need a few things: </p>

<p>1. Foobar </p>

<p>2. foo_dop.dll - http://bit.ly/dBI3Cm </p>

<p>3. foo_audioscrobbler - http://bit.ly/cRBrGj </p>

<p>Place both dlls in your components folder and then restart foobar.</p>

<p>In File&gt;Preferences select Audioscrobbler and fill out your username and password, the click &quot;Import played tracks from portable devices&quot;. You should then be able to sync your iPod by going to File&gt;iPod and clicking synchronise. You don't have to fully synchronise it though check out View&gt;Console to see if there are any problems or how many tracks you've scrobbled.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that's it, enjoy!</p>
