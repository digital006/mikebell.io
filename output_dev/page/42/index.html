        </header>
        <div>
            <p>After having quite a few months off from coffee I'm finally back into it and brewing again.</p>

<p>This is an updated method I use for brewing Aeropress without any hassle and only the minimum amount of effort. Hopefully you should get some pretty good results from it.</p>

<p>My setup has actually changed since my last post, I've ditched paper filters in favour of the <a href="http://coava.myshopify.com/products/disk-coffee-filter">Coava Disk</a>. I find this gives a much smoother cup with a greater depth and texture. If your used to the paper filters then when switching to the disk you'll see a huge difference in a number of different factors, namely speed of the plunge. My one issue with the disk is that coffee seems to stick to the disk when you plunge, this probably has some effect on the overall cup but I'll come to how I combat that in the instructions.</p>

<p>The one piece of equipment I really really wish I had is a <a href="http://www.hasbean.co.uk/products/Hario-V60-Coffee-Drip-Kettle-'Buono'.html">VarioV60 Kettle</a> just to give some kind of flow control as my kettle really sucks and it's very difficult to get a even pour. This may all sound like hard work but it's not trust me! So now for the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Boil kettle...</li>
<li>Pre-heat cup with hot water</li>
<li>Pour grinds into inverted aeropress (usually around 3cm up when plunger is at 5).</li>
<li>Leave water to cool for 30s to 1min.</li>
<li>Pour water over grinds evenly, I don't pre-wet as it's futile with my kettle. If done correctly you should see a nice crema.</li>
<li>Stir 5-6 time to make sure grinds are soaked.</li>
<li>Leave for 1 to 1:30 mins</li>
<li>Pour hot water out of cup</li>
<li>Stir grinds once more to make sure that none stick to the disk</li>
<li>Put on disk and plastic cover</li>
<li>Invert and plunge (plunging should roughly take 15-30 seconds depending on grind size, my pre-ground filter from Hasbeans takes roughly 20 seconds)</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>DRINK!</li>
</ol>

<p>13-ish steps for a nice cup of coffee not bad, total time of process when streamlined is roughly 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Enjoy,</p>

        <div>
            <p>I decided to move to Ack for searching as it has nice switches like --php and --nosql.</p>

<p>By default ack doesn't recognise .module, .install or .inc files so you have to add them. Create a .ackrc file in your home directory and add the following:</p>

<p><code>
--type-set=drupal=.module,.install,.inc</code></p>

            <p>It's that time again now that I'm well and truly full of drupalflu.</p>

<p>This years pickings were slim to none, not that there wasn't anything great out there but I just didn't have the time to go out and grab any. My time was spent attending sessions and talking to potential new clients on our booth (which was awesome!).</p>

<p>I did however grab a conference t-shirt which is great, as someone who collects a lot of cool and interesting shirts this one was pretty amazing, so congrats to the designers.</p>

<p>This years conference was great, so many good sessions to attend and as always it was great to meet up with other drupal people including lots from #drupal-uk. I'm so pleased I got to see Batman Live I thought it was a great show and even after my skeptisism it was worth it.</p>

<p>I came away with so many ideas that I can't wait to put into fluition. I particuarly like drush deploy, looking forward to seeing that get a stable release. I attended a great BoF on Kit/Build Kit/Features, something that I've been using for a while now.</p>

<p>Next years european DrupalCon is in Munich... Beer Beer and more Beer!</p>
