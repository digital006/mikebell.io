            <h2><a href="/blog/2014/12/09/cbt-update">CBT Update</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I gave up on CBT. The sessions were too infrequent and sporadic. I really didn’t like the over the phone sessions either they were too impersonal and didn’t really contribute anything.</p>

<p>The one thing I did get out of the sessions was helpful pointers with where i need to focus and what tools I need to give myself to be able to cope with things in the long run.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’ve started practising mediation, it gives me a sense of being and helps me re-connect my body and mind.</li>
<li>I analyse my feelings more, this helps determine the cause of my anxiety and allows me to bring myself out of the spiral that are anxiety attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>So where do I go from here, I’m looking into more traditional therapy now, I intend to continue meditation and medication for a while longer.</p>

<p>I find I’m smiling more and more each day, I’m happy.

            <h2><a href="/blog/2014/11/30/streaming-services">Thoughts on Video Streaming Services</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Since I no longer have a magical content providing server in France I've been trying out a few  different streaming services. Apparently this is a lot harder than it seems!</p>

<h1 id="pre-reqs">Pre Reqs</h1>

<ul>
<li>HD - must be HD where available</li>
<li>Large library</li>
<li>Available on multiple libraries</li>
<li>Linux compatible</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="google-play">Google Play</h1>

<p>I'm not sure about this service. It's ok I got a Transformers movie free when I got my Nexus 7 tablet but I'm not 100% sold on it. The HD film worked well on my tablet but I never got around to seeing if it was available on a desktop.</p>

<h1 id="amazon-instant">Amazon Instant</h1>

<p>This looks so promising but fell short masively when it came to HD streaming. Aparently I won't stream HD content properly on Linux because of HCDP DRM. So this is out for now.</p>

<p>The one thing I do like about this is it seems to have a relatively up to date collection and you can always purchase things that aren't available to stream. You also get free one day shipping on Amazon which is always nice.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if you can stream on a mobile device or not.</p>

<h1 id="netflix">Netflix</h1>

<p>Netflix has a wierd library it's geo-locked to US and UK with the former having an arguably better library. It's mobile apps are brilliant and the profile support is also great.</p>

<p>Currently I'm using all my profiles, one for Hannah and her dad, the other for my brother and the last one for my parents. My parents use it on their PS3 and Nexus 7, my brother uses it on his computer and Hannah uses it on her TV and laptop. So overall it supports a huge amount of devices which is quite impressive. And all this for such a low price.</p>

<p>I've setup a VPN in the US so I can access the US version of Netflix which is pretty cool.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>While not a hugely scientific comparison of the services I feel that Netflix is by far the clear winner here for me and my family. I'm hoping that the competition can catch up soon.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2014/11/29/the-move-to-ubuntu">The Move to Ubuntu</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I finally did it! I moved from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 14.04. It's not entirely great but it's working and I can make as many changes as I want.</p>

<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>

<p>Unity Launcher - Honestly it's damned annoying, I hate how I can't move it to the right hand side of the screen which would be much better with my dual monitor configuration.</p>

<p>2nd Sound Card didn't work - Troubleshooted it and for once everything actually seemed ok. I had to install a 3rd party mixer to find that the card was muted and worked.</p>

<p>Default Ubuntu still looks butt ugly. Fixed that with a new theme and some tweaks that I'll cover later.</p>

<p>Weird font issues in Firefox, there is a bug report going back to 13.04 but no movement on it.</p>

<h1 id="solutions-and-tweaks">Solutions and Tweaks</h1>

<p>Unity Launcher - I've hidden it and switched to using Cairo Dock which acts as a nice copy of the OSX dock. Still need to figure out how to get it accross two screens.</p>

<p>I've installed the Numix theme and Unity Tweak Tools to configure my desktop. It's looking a lot nicer now.</p>

<p>Solarized Dark and Andale Mono font in terminal, also disable bold font in terminal preferences as it just doesn't look good.</p>

<p>Netflix in Firefox - You can get netflix to work in firefox by using Pipelight I followed this guide - http://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/pipelight-use-silverlight-in-your-linux.html - you'll also need to switch your user agent for Netflix to work. I'm currently watching Sword Art Online in another Firefox window (I'm hoping the story gets better!)</p>

<p>Hopefully I'll post more tweaks later for reference. I'm still getting used to a few things and there's still a lot more learning to do.</p>
