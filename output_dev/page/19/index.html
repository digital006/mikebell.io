        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I had my second round of CBT today and it went much better than the first round. This time I took a bottle of water with me it gave me something to focus on and stop my hands from getting all weird, it's also amazing how thirsty you get during these things.</p>

<p>The session was focused on a few situations over the past few weeks where I've had issues with anxiety and panic attacks. We identified things about the situations and how I should be dealing with them.</p>

<p>I feel much more positive after today's session and I'm glad that I'm sticking with it, I can see that this will help me and provide me with the tools to help control my thoughts better.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Today I had my first CBT session. I’m hugely conflicted, I don’t know what I was expecting. My session was just a reiteration of the initial phone introduction. It seemed like a waste of time to me, I’m not discounting CBT at all.</p>

<p>I was given a pro-forma thought journal to fill out for the next sessions (earliest was 3 weeks!!!), I’d already seen this in the initial documentation that I’d been sent so I could have done this in preparation for this meeting rather than the next.</p>

<p>While we didn’t go into anything of substance in terms of CBT I did realise a few key things:</p>

<ol>
<li>If this doesn’t work I’m going to have to work harder to sort things out for myself.</li>
<li>I really need to talk to someone professional about my feelings.</li>
<li>Psychotherapy is a damned hard job for someone, who do psychologists go to talk to?</li>
</ol>

<p>Points 1 and 2 are huge steps in the right directions so who knows maybe it is working, subliminally… ** Buy me beer ** ** waves hand in the air mystically **</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Again it’s been too long since my last post, I seem to come up with ideas and start planning it out in my head only to end up with a rambling nonsensical rant on where I am and what I’ve gone through. This time I’m going to structure it and make sure I get my point across.</p>

<h2 id="honesty">Honesty</h2>

<p>I’m now a lot more honest, with myself and those around me. It’s vital to where I am that I am honest, it’ll help detect and issues in the future and make sure that I keep those around me in the loop about how I’m feeling. This has become so vital to how I recover as I can no longer hide behind lies and the misconception that everything is fine.</p>

<h2 id="medication">Medication</h2>

<p>I’m currently on two types of medication, one for anxiety and one for depression. These have both helped a hell of a lot and I don’t think I’d be where I am without them. That being said I need to slowly come off them, this is scaring me  more than I thought it would, I’m not sure what part of my mind is me recovering or the medication. I guess I will just have to see what happens once I start to come off them.</p>

<h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>

<p>A friend pointed me towards <a href="https://twitter.com/funkatron">@funkatron</a> and his set of talks on Open Source and Mental Health, these have helped me get a better grasp on things, I highly suggest you check them out. I’m currently in the process of putting together a lightning talk for PHPNW on some of the subjects <a href="https://twitter.com/funkatron">@funkatron</a> touches on and what I’ve been through these past few months. It’s important for me that I can help anyone in anyway, even if it’s just 20 minutes and only one person turns up.</p>
