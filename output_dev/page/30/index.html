            <p>I've started working on some really cool projects now that I have a bit of time spare. I have 4 that I'm running concurrently which is quite a lot considering at least 2 of them are quite big.</p>

<p>Knowing what you've achieved is an excellent way of keeping motivated and running that side by side with what's to be done gives you an overview of the entire project. To manage my projects I'm using Trello.com which has a really great interface and is dead easy to setup.</p>

<p>I'm fairly sure I'm using a bastardised version of Kanban but it's proving an effective management tool. Well worth a shot.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>After 3 and a half years at Ixis I'm sad to say goodbye. I think it's time to move on and explore new opportunities. My time at Ixis has been great, the people are amazing and it's been a pleasure to help shape their infrastructure and deliver sites for them.</p>

<p>I'll be joining CTI mid August as Drupal Technical Architect a role which I cannot wait to start, I'm also looking forward to working with Paul Johnson and Mark West. It will allow me to do more development (no more support YES!!!) and work on Drupal 7 and 8 with a bigger team to deliver technically challenging projects.</p>

<p>I wish everyone at Ixis good luck in the future and to give me a shout if they ever fancy a beer in Manchester.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Six months is a long time, it's a percentage of my life gone.</p>

<p>Just over six months ago things were a lot different. I'd never have guess I'd be here right now writing this. It's amusing how various acts can shape and change your life.</p>

<p>I watched as fate played a cruel joke on my grandmother as she lost her memory and personality then I watched with relief as she passed away.</p>

<p>I made the wrong decision something I regretted until a month ago.</p>

<p>I met the women who I intend to spend the rest of my life with. I stood by her as her mother repeatedly went in and out of hospital. I watched as her mother died and held her close as she went through one of the toughest times of her life.</p>

<p>I decided there weren't enough photos of me and I didn't want to regret not remembering the good times.</p>

<p>I learnt that there's more to life than working.</p>

<p>I chose to take risks and move out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>That's what can happen in six months. So with this day marks my last at Ixis, I'll be taking a two week vacation before starting at CTI Digital late August where I hope to face new challenges and create some really cool things. My leaving is the culmination of all of the above. My time at Ixis has been great but I'm ready to move on.</p>

<p>Here's me relaxing recently and learning to start fresh:</p>
