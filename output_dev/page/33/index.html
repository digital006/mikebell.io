            <p>There's no easy way to put this but as of this post I'm withdrawing from organising DrupalCamp NW 2013.</p>

<p>A lot of things have changed over the past 4 months some good some not so. I intend to spend as much time with my friends and family and avoid the stress of organising the event.</p>

<p>Where does this leave the event? Pretty much in the same place as it was a few months ago, I'd love for more people to step up and take charge of the event. Nothing would make me happier than attending DCNW 2013 as an attendee for a change! Hell I might actually see some sessions.</p>

<p>If you would like to get involved then please come along to the next NWDUG (7pm 1st May at Madlab) or get in touch with either me or Phil Norton.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As a developer it's in my best interest to keep up to date with the current technologies and techniques industry leaders are using. Over the past few years I've been signed up to many lists from companies that provide webinars.</p>

<p>Every so often one crosses my increasingly unmanageable inbox that peaks my interest. At first I was all wide eyed and eager looking to see what these so called "experts" (a word that no longer has the correct meaning) had to say on the given subject matter. Now not so much. Webinars have become a bit of a joke for me, I see them and think "you know what that looks great" then I have to double check who's running it.</p>

<p>I get that these things aren't free and you as a viewer have to pay a price, usually listening to a company hawk it's services but make sure there's more value for me!</p>

<p>The last webinar I attended/watched sealed the deal for me, it was about a subject that I <em>needed</em> to know about, just when it got the good part I was greeted by the words "if your looking for more then contact our sales team". This for me is why "webinar" is a dirty word and will be until someone proves otherwise.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2013/04/12/testing-with-codeception-and-drupal-projects">Testing with Codeception and Drupal Projects</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As part of my increased like of agile development and the control it gives you over your estimates and deliverables I've become increasingly aware of the horrible fact our code coverage sucks. There's no real way to sugar coat it we don't do proper testing, it's bugged me for years.</p>

<h2 id="technical-debt">Technical Debt</h2>

<p>I first read of technical debt over 5 years at my previous job, the basics of technical debt are that every hack/bodge job will bite you in the ass and you will spend more time fixing things in the long run that implementing it correctly. Now this is where agile comes in, with better estimations it allows you to factor in more unknowns, break down user stories into smaller more achievable tasks and ultimately give you a higher level of what is to be achieved.</p>

<h2 id="with-smaller-tasks-comes-great-responsibility">With smaller tasks comes great responsibility</h2>

<p>When you break down each user story into a task it gives you a clear set of deliverables, now both the user and developer are clear on what needs to be achieved. Now with this method there's no more "that was way too ambiguous", you should now exactly what has to be delivered. So on completion of that test how do you confidently say it's complete? There are two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Suck it and see, mark task as complete and let client figure it out</li>
<li>Test the thing and test it hard and repeatedly.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="over-and-over-and-over-and-over-again">Over and over and over and over again</h2>

<p>So now you know what you have to deliver, you should test it. Here's where codeception comes in, it's a framework that allows you to quickly (and I mean quickly!) write acceptance testing for you application. It also integrates with other types of testing (e.g. unit tests) but lets start small.</p>

<p>With each task you should always create a test, each test should actually test functionality, remember don't test for the sake of it!</p>

<h2 id="getting-down-to-it">Getting down to it</h2>

<ol>
<li>Install it - http://codeception.com/install</li>
<li>Create your fist acceptance test:
 <code>php codecept.phar generate:cept acceptance DrupalUserLogin</code></li>
<li><p>Write your first test:
<code>
$I = new WebGuy($scenario);
$I->wantTo('Ensure Drupal Login Works');
$I->amOnPage('/user');
$I->fillField('edit-name', 'digital');
$I->fillField('edit-pass', 'THIS IS MY REAL PASS');
$I->click('edit-submit');
$I->see('digital');</code></p></li>
<li><p>Define your site (tests/acceptance.suite.yml):</p></li>
</ol>

<p><code>
class_name: WebGuy
modules:
    enabled: [PhpBrowser, WebHelper]
    config:
        PhpBrowser:
            url: 'drupal.org'</code></p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Run the badger! - <code>php codecept.phar run</code></li>
<li>Bask in the glory of your first test.</li>
</ol>

<p>There it is, dead easy to do! There's no reason you shouldn't implement this for every task in your sprint backlog.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here%3F">Where to go from here?</h2>

<p>After playing around with this for a few hours I seem to be doing the same thing. Each test requires me to login as I don't think each test environment shares session/cookies. I need to figure out a way of creating a codeception module which allows you to plug in a drupal testing user (ideally multiple so you can test each role) and then all the you have to do is call a function which executes the above steps to confirm your logged in before testing authenticated behaviour.</p>

<p>Something along the lines of:</p>

<p><code>$I->drupalLogin('editor');</code></p>

<h2 id="why-will-this-work%3F">Why will this work?</h2>

<p>When you initially set out estimation of each story you should add an extra 5-10% for testing. This way you can cover the additional time taken to write these tests. Trust me it's worth it in the long run!</p>

<h2 id="update-20%2F05%2F13">Update 20/05/13</h2>
