            <p>On Friday the 22nd there will be sprints at Techhub which run in parallel with the business day at Drupal Camp NW 13. I'm hoping to be there for the sprints pending confirmation of my holiday!</p>

<p>After the sprints/business day it makes sense for everyone to get together and go grab some food and drinks. Since everyone will be around the northern quarter we should make the most of it.</p>

<p>For food/drinks we'll head to A Place Called Common, they serve great burgers and have food suitable for vegetarians (not sure about vegan).</p>

<p>If your not fussed about drinking then next door there is Home Sweet Home which serves a great Pulled Pork and Sweet Potato bowl.</p>

<p>After food and a few drinks we can move on to Odd Bar / Trof / Marble Beer House or head the other way to Port Street Beer House / Whisky Jar / Kosmonoaut (also does food but gets really busy). This is up to you guys, they're all great bars but offer different things.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the Manchester Christmas markets will be open which is always good as long as it's not raining (can't promise anything!). The Albert Square (town hall) markets are open till 9pm, they'll be busy but they offer a great atmosphere and come with beer and food.</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments if anyone has any preferences or would like suggestions for anything. Here's a map of some of the venues - http://eatmanc.mikebell.io/</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>On the 22nd October Manchester saw it’s very first Drupal Sprint, this was run in parallel with London Sprints.</p>

<p>Regular sprints are now becoming a great way to help out with Drupal Core and Contrib. In the UK there are now two sprints covering London and Manchester. In India there are 3 user groups all sprinting regularly. No doubt there are some in the US and in other countries.</p>

<p>Sprints unlike regular user groups are an ideal place to flex your code knowledge and get your hands dirty. With initiatives such as the Drupal Ladder it’s proving that everyone can contribute in some fashion whether this be via code, documentation or testing. Within the first 30 minutes of Drupal Sprints Manchester we had our first commit to a contributed project (Omega 4) by a first time contributor.</p>

<p>We communicated with London via Google Hangouts where we updated each other on our progress, I know in the past that London has spoken with India an impressive feat considering the time difference.</p>

<p>It’s not out of the realms of possibility to organise a monthly world-wide sprint. The idea being that user groups all over the world organise a sprint for a specific date with the aim of working on core and contrib. I believe this will be possible with a minimal amount of effort as we can offload a lot of the organisation to each user group. Coordination of communication can be done through IRC. It would be a great publicity stunt as well, something that every country could benefit from especially in the run up to Drupal 8 release.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in a world wide sprint comment below and lets organise something!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> - Thanks for the extra information Berdir and YesCT. It's really cool to see the community come together for things like this. Subject to our venue being available Manchester will be ready to sprint on the 25th January.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>For me the the Drupal community is amazing, it's always felt like a family, one you can rely on to help and support you.</p>

<p>It's time for a call to arms, people need to support their local and regional Drupal user groups and events. A lot of these events are volunteer run, it takes time and energy to run meetup after meetup and big events. The people that organise and run these events are quite something, 9 to 5 days don't exist for them.</p>

<p>So this is where you come in, it's easy to help out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Volunteering - everyone needs volunteers, get in touch with your local usergroup or next camp and see if they need your help.</li>
<li>Sponsorship - camps aren't free, they cost money and no one likes to talk about it. If your a company or individual then please consider sponsoring your local camp/meetup. It gets your name out there and some extra brownie points within the community.</li>
<li>Spreading the word - advertise your local camp/meetup, tell your friends and colleagues, blog and tweet about it. It all helps.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm lucky to have worked with some great people on both NWDUG (North West Drupal User Group) and DrupalCamp NW 12 so I know how much the smallest of contribution can help.</p>

<p>If your in the UK and looking to support your local or regional group then take a look at DrupalCamp NW 2013 - http://camp2013.nwdrupal.org.uk/ - they're looking for sponsors and volunteers.</p>
