        <div>
            <p>Since moving to a new house I have an proper office for the first time so I'm determined to get it right.</p>

<p>I asked on twitter what remote workers would suggest, here are the results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coffee shops as a nice change of scenery - @jjmu15</li>
<li>A recurring theme is good headphones!</li>
<li>A closed door to indicate "do no disturb" - @blakehall</li>
<li>Good music - @jbloomfield</li>
<li>Good coffee (duh!) - @jbloomfield</li>
<li>Comfortable chair - @hussainweb</li>
<li>Good lighting - @lewisnyman @hussainweb</li>
<li>Good mic - @longwave</li>
</ul>

<p>I have most of these already so it's just a case of getting it actually set up.</p>

<p>My keyboard is pretty loud so not sure how that's going to go down!</p>

            <p>I fucked up and I fucked up badly.</p>

<p>A few months ago I went cold turkey on propranolol (against all feedback) and after a few weeks the side effects went away and I was fine.</p>

<p>A week ago I decided to stop taking Citalopram cold turkey. This was not a good idea.</p>

<p>Currently I'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms, they're not very nice and they make working and life very difficult.</p>

<p>My symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hazy head</li>
<li>Extreme emotions</li>
<li>Quick to anger</li>
<li>Tension headaches</li>
</ul>

<p>I've learnt my lesson and I'm going back up to 20mg and will sort out tapering off properly.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Today I'm feeling better after going back on them, still a bit hazy and my head aches but I'm a lot better. Don't fuck around with SSRIs</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2015/10/13/finite-energy">Finite Energy</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I have a finite amount of energy. My energy comes in a few different forms, all important to how I feel on a day to day basis.</p>

<p>I find myself applying energy in the wrong place now. Energy that I put in often doesn't yield the results I expect or frankly deserve. I've found myself questioning more of my decisions recently and the outcome of that has been eye opening to me.</p>

<p>At the moment I put my energy in to the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work, coding and process.</li>
<li>House</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Community</li>
</ul>

<p>The energy I put into all these things is something I'm quite proud of considering my situation however I've been slowly changing things.</p>

<p>I'm shifting my energy from work (except coding) because I don't get the results I expect out of it. It's a waste of energy to be involved in process when I enjoy coding so much. This is pretty tough though, I have a lot of pride in what I do, I strive to always do my best, promote coding standards, limit and remove technical debt. All these things I enjoy so much. But I think I'm getting too invested in the project and end product. The energy I put in does not equal the return I get. I spend too much time being worried, nervous and down at how things are going even though I'm doing my best.</p>

<p>Now that I've moved into my new house I need to focus more energy on it, there are so many little things that need doing (which reminds me I need to sort the washing machine out tonight!). The return of energy in my house is enormous being able to come home and crash on my sofa is amazing.</p>

<p>With the new house comes Hannah, she's awesome and deserves me at my best without her I don't think any of this would be worth it.</p>

<p>Community has always been something I love, I want to spend even more time working in it. This comes in two forms. I intend to submit as many CFPs as possible over the next few months and I want to commit even more code to contributed projects. There's a buzz I get from working with the Drupal/PHP community that just can't be beaten.</p>

<p>With the end of this post comes a new caveat to my blog:</p>

<p>Views and opinions represented here are mine and not representative of my employer.</p>
