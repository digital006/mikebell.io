            <p><em>This is hopefully going to be the one of the first of many posts going through the motions of organising DrupalCamp NW 2013 or project "WTF are you doing???"</em></p>

<p>The full title of this post is "We went big, now to go bigger". What do I mean by this? Well for start 2012 was amazing the fact that we managed to pull it off and provide such a great event means that we have a lot of work to do. So what next? Well...</p>

<ol>
<li>Money - no one likes to talk about it, but these things don't come free or cheap!</li>
<li>Venue - this is a tough one, we had a great first venue but if we want to go bigger then...</li>
<li>Speakers - our quality it 2012 was amazing we need to equal this and go beyond.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="money">Money</h2>

<p>To get money we need sponsors, 2012s sponsors were great! I mean really great, they made things super easy and gave us the capital to create what we did.</p>

<p>How are we going to manage it for 2013, to be honest pretty much the same way, the major difference is that all tickets will be handled through Eventbrite rather than through Ubercart.</p>

<h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>

<p>We have some big decisions to make, if we want to go bigger then we're going to have to look elsewhere. The University of Salford had a max capacity of 150, now this might sound like a lot but you can guarantee that even if you sell out your not going to get that amount turning up, it sucks but that's the way these things go.</p>

<p>So where else can we go, well we're currently looking at a few potential venues and hopefully we can pull something together.</p>

<p>By no means have we discounted UoS! But there's no harm in looking around.</p>

<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>

<p>This goes without saying that 2012 had a tough act to follow, this year we'll be extending invitations out for people to come keynote as well as do special sessions. As per usual we will be opening up community submissions which will go through the same voting process as last year (more to come in a post later).</p>

<p>I hope this post is enough to wet your appetite on what's to come in the next few months!</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p><strong><em>The following was written and unedited on 13th March 2013 the day after my Grandma died.</em></strong></p>

<p>Death is never an easy subject to tackle, it's something that everyone must face in their own time. Whether it be a close relative or friend death happens and you can't avoid that.</p>

<p>What perplexes me is why death is such a taboo subject, gone are the days when the thought of it used to paralyze me with fear.</p>

<p>Yesterday my grandma passed away and I'm happy, yes happy. She was in a lot of pain and she wasn't the person I knew her to be. I subscribe to no major religions but I like to think she's in a better place now whatever that may be.</p>

<p>The majority of my granparents are now gone, none have passed in nice ways. All have suffered in some way, lately it seems more horrific. I'm a firm believer in Euthanasia, there comes a point when people just want to pass on. I don't understand why it's not possible to help your loved ones do this in the UK.</p>

<p><strong><em>The following was written on the 27th March nearly a week after the funeral.</em></strong></p>

<p>I considered deleting the above as understandably I was emotional, however I feel it's still relevant.</p>

<p>I remember my Grandpa being ready even when cancer had robbed him of his former glory. I remember shaking his hand and him saying how proud he was of me and I left the room never to see him again. I remember how frail he looked. That is a memory I wish I didn't have, it over shadows the other good memories.</p>

<p>While my parents and family were sorting out my grandparents house my uncle found a book on perfumery and asked to pass it on to me, these are the memories I want to have of my grandparents.</p>

<p>My thoughts on Euthanasia will not change and while it's not always applicable I find it quite sad that the UK treats people as criminals when they're helping with their relatives last wishes.</p>

<p>I hope to live to see the day when it's no longer a crime and people are given the right to assisted suicide.</p>

<p>I don't have a living will (yet) but I've spoken to my Dad about the death and my plans should anything happen to me. We both have a mutual understanding of what has to be done.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I'm on a train heading back from drupal camp London, after a great weekend it got me thinking what is a camp and where do you draw the line?</p>

<p>With over 300 sign ups its rumoured to be one (if not) largest camps in the Europe. At what point so you say it was a conference? The Saturday saw 5 tracks (3 more than NW) with talks lasting 30 minutes. I'm inclined to say that the original idea of a camp has grown way bigger than expected as the rise in drupals popularity has increased.</p>

<p>With the emphasis on community still being the same the quality has increased massively. I love the fact the UK is now producing these large scale camps, it says volumes for the community and those involved in organising them. I hope this trend of producing camps in the same vein as the early drupalcons continues bigger.</p>

<p>Having said this it makes me realise how far the UK has come in terms of organisation. We still don't have a central body but I don't think it's too far off. I think it's key that those involved in the camps organisation get together and pool resources to make these events bigger and better over the next few years.</p>
