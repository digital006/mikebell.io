            <h2><a href="/blog/2013/06/09/theorycrafting-drupal-deployment-via-bittorrent">Theorycrafting Drupal Deployment Via Bittorrent</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>There was an article floating around a few weeks ago about deploying large scale applications to multiple servers through bittorrent. I remember being at a talk by a Facebook developer who mentioned they did the same. I figured I'd put some thought into how it could be done at a practical level for Drupal sites.</p>

<p>Tools Needed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jenkins - http://jenkins-ci.org/</li>
<li>mktorrent - http://mktorrent.sourceforge.net/</li>
<li>rtorrent/libtorrent - http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/</li>
<li>ocelot/gazelle - https://what.cd/gazelle/</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="jenkins">Jenkins</h2>

<p>Jenkins can be used to tie all the separate tools together.</p>

<h2 id="mktorrent">mktorrent</h2>

<p>A cli tool to build .torrent files which can be pushed off to remote servers. This can integrate with Jenkins to build the torrent based of Jenkins variables.</p>

<h2 id="rtorrent%2Flibtorrent">rtorrent/libtorrent</h2>

<p>This is a command line torrent client, it can be setup to watch from a directory on the remote server. It then starts downloading files once a new torrent is places into the watch directory.</p>

<h2 id="ocelot%2Fgazelle">Ocelot/Gazelle</h2>

<p>High performance bittorrent tracker and web front end. This can be used to manage connections between all your web front ends.</p>

<h2 id="sample-workflow">Sample Workflow</h2>

<ol>
<li>Developer pushes code to specific git branch</li>
<li>Jenkins fires a build to pull down the latest code (Build 1)</li>
<li>After Build 1 finishes mktorrent runs to package a .torrent file (Build 2)</li>
<li>Torrent file is published to Gazelle (Build 2)</li>
<li>After Build 2 finishes torrent file is pushed to all remote servers</li>
<li>Each rtorrent instances starts download of files</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>Things become a bit complex once the files have been distributed via torrents, my main concern would be how to reliably switch over to the new files once the download has completed. rtorrent does have the ability to issue commands once a download has finished but I'm unsure whether it could potentially run an external script.</p>

<p>Drupal is small (averaging 16-30mb for a normal site Drupal 7) so bittorrent isn't the most effective method of distributing a codebase.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>Error Detections - Ability to reliably say you have exactly what's expected
Speed - All web server will be providing upstream so in theory the only slow part will be disk IO and downstream connection.</p>

<p>Overall this is an interesting thought experiment would quite like to try it out one day.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2013/05/27/better-and-smarter-notifications">Better and Smarter Notifications</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I'm sat in my living room in front of my PC, I have my Nexus phone to the right of me just next to my mouse and my Nexus 7 is sat on table behind me. When I get tagged in a Google Plus post I get notified 5 times.</p>

<ol>
<li>My PC shows that I have a new email from G+</li>
<li>My phone notification goes off twice, once for G+ app and another for email</li>
<li>My tablet notification goes off twice, once for G+ app and another for email</li>
</ol>

<p>OK so this sounds very much like first world problems, hell it is but still it poses an interesting problem. How do we get better and smarter notifications?</p>

<h2 id="one-account">One Account</h2>

<p>What one thing in common do the above 3 items have in common? They're all tied to my google account, theoretically this solves one problem already, I have a way of syncing message statuses and preferences.</p>

<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>

<p>On my phone and tablet I've reduced the noise by turning off notification in G+ app. I had to do this manually on both devices. Why aren't these options synced? I'm signed into the same google account on both devices therefore I should be able to sync my preferences, something that Chrome already does between multiple machines.</p>

<h2 id="smarter-android-notifications">Smarter Android Notifications</h2>

<p>Why did my phone and tablet need to notify me twice about the same content? On face value the notifications came from two separate apps (G+ and Gmail). Contextually they're the same. I'd like to see some form of unified messaging layer, a message comes through and has something unique about it. Androids notification layer then determines which app is best delivering this to the user, conceptually this is very powerful. In this case G+ app would be the best but imagine if I was close to my data limit or in a poor service area where purely textual data would be appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="proximity">Proximity</h2>

<p>In this current usage situation all my devices are within a few meters of me, I don't need to be notified by all of them. When I go to work my PC is off, my tablet is next to my bed and my phone is in my pocket, in this situation I want all my notifications to my phone. On the other hand as I'm writing this I'm sat at my computer so therefore I want all notifications to this machine. When I'm reading in bed I want all notifications to my tablet etc etc.</p>

<p>The next logical step would be to have notifications managed by proximity. I'd love to see this but integration between all these different services would have to be pretty tight something which just isn't there yet.</p>

<p>Notifications is something that will no doubt become more and more important as our wired society becomes more ingrained with new and existing technology. I'm looking forward to when I can get my hands on prescription google glasses. My only concern is privacy, in wanting all these features technology must become more invasive and in this particular case google would have to have a bigger insight into my every day life. Either way it's an interesting topic to think about.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>A few years ago I adminned a large IRC channel for indie music, during my time as OP I meet a guy called Garrett (film42) we started chatting over our like for indie music and technology. Over the years we kept on chatting and our focus moved away from music and further into technology.</p>

<p>We both have a love for computers and internet technology. From the start of our friendship I knew there was something special about him, he's driven more driven than most people of that age are.</p>

<p>Over the past year it's been really interesting listening to him talk about his project Grasswire (http://grasswire.com/). I've been lucky enough to be on the outside looking in at a pretty cool project.</p>

<p>Real time web fascinates me, when I compare what Garrett has done with Grasswire to every Drupal project I've worked on I'm just amazed at how fast it is and how different technology is. The technologies he's leveraging to make Grasswire as scalable and fast as it is are great, problems occur that just don't exist in the glacially slow environment that Drupal lives in, this in turn leads to some really interesting solutions.</p>

<p>As well as having an insight into the technologies I've also been lucky to see into how cool entrepreneurship in America is. To me this almost voyeurism into the American tech seen has been an eye opener. I'm quite jealous at the opportunities Garrett has, sure it's hard work but I'm sure he'll be able to pull it off.</p>
