        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I've been holding this off for a few weeks now, but it's always been at the back of my mind. I'm a developer at heart, have been for over 10 years and I subscribe to the majority of the developer norms (thankfully not all).</p>

<p>It's no secret that I've been involved in organising a DrupalCamp for Manchester. It's hard work and it's stressful.</p>

<p>It's not something that would come easy to a developer, it's a task that most developers wouldn't even attempt. However I feel I'm up to the challenge and the timing is right.</p>

<p>This post is mostly about what I've learnt, the camp is still a work in progress but I've learnt so much stuff:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't do this! It's hard work, it's very very stressful (I've made many angry phone calls today).</li>
<li>If you do decide to go with it get a good team, seriously a good team is great, I'm lucky and have a great one who I can trust to get stuff done. We all have our own unique talents which makes spreading the work load a lot easier.</li>
<li>Get a venue, get it early and get the paperwork. All my stress over the past few weeks has been down to this one fact alone.</li>
<li>Get sponsors, they're key to providing some early needed funds.</li>
<li>Use people's contacts! It makes it much easier to get stuff done, especially with suppliers.</li>
</ol>

<p>So this is where we get to the "Now you can panic" part, we've still got a lot of work to do but it's finally coming together.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/23/support-ticket-manifesto">Support Ticket Manifesto</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I've been doing support for over 2 years now, I have such a love hate relationship with it.</p>

<p>I hate the generic support requests that go along the lines of "ZOMG IT'S ALL BROKEN" (actual ticket, well not really), but I love the complex issues, those that can actually engage me and force me to bring out my debugging skills.</p>

<p>Every support ticket falls into 2 camps, those that make you scream and those that make you think, I'd say 90% are those that make you scream. This is why I'm proposing the following manifesto:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You WILL include Browser and OS information - "It doesn't work" is not good enough and will just make things take longer, ultimately we have to bounce the ticket back for more info so do us a favour and start out with as much possible.</p></li>
<li><p>URLS for the love of whatever deity you follow please include a url, your not our only client and chances are you host more than one site with us. Also chances are we aren't 100% familiar with your site so a specific url will help us target the issue. Oh yeah and it helps us to grep logs as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Time the issue was noted, again we have logs if you can narrow down the timeframe that would help both you and us!</p></li>
<li><p>"Just one more thing" - NO NO NO start a new ticket, I'm going to forget about your second issue if it's deep in a ticket 30 replies long.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the difference between a feature request and bug, it sounds easy but you'd be surprised how many times people get it wrong!</p></li>
<li><p>Don't phone to say you've put a ticket in, we know you have and while I have one hand on the phone talking to you I can't work as fast.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't leave your ticket open, if we've fixed it then close it stating your happy with the response.</p></li>
<li><p>Where possible include a screenshot, visual aids help a lot more than a wall of text, also follow below rule.</p></li>
<li><p>The following formats are not acceptable for screenshots - ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, doc, docx, odt.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, thanks us. A happy support monkey is a productive support monkey.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: Some more rules!</p>

<ol start="11">
<li><p>My time estimates are final, if you can do it faster then fuck you do it yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>You're not our only client! Shocking I know but sometimes we work with other people.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So there it is, follow these simple rules and we won't hunt you down and knife you.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>It's that time of year again where I need a holiday and the opportunity to get away from everything.</p>

<p>This week a colleague flippantly said that I'd be unable to switch off and required an internet connection. I was kind of offended by this as they assumed that they actually knew me.</p>

<p>To me holidays are sacred they're a time when you get to switch off and relax. Something that may seem quite alien to those in the business. I don't require an internet connection. In fact I look forward to not having one. Sure its handy but switching off is something I enjoy doing and feel necessary every now and then.</p>
