        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Time is a funny thing, we emblazen it on our phones, our wrists, on our walls in every facet of our daily lives. It controls us whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>When I first experienced death it was one of the hardest things to deal with, the resounding thing that people said was that "time heals everything". Well I call bullshit to this day I'm still hurt by the death of my grandmother. She was a wonderful person taken from us far too early.</p>

<hr />

<p>Time really is a funny thing. You can listen to a ticking clock and witness as it passes you by.</p>

<p>My time at school wasn't the best like most geeks (a badge I wear proudly now) I was bullied. I suppressed those memories and I have little recollection of my time there. I remember the people though, I can never forget them, they're etched in my memory, a hatred that I'm not sure I can ever forgive.</p>

<hr />

<p>Time is a constant. Yet it seems to either fly or crawl by. Time flies when you're having fun and crawls when you're bored.</p>

<p>I broke down 3 months ago, that's ~7.88923e6 seconds. That's a large number. It's a lot of time to reflect on things. What scares me is at 28 years old it's 1% of my life. And just by writing this it's growing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Time is an odd thing. Time slips by, the world still revolves around us, friends and family laugh and cry, we lose loved ones, we gain loved ones. What we're not prepared for is how to deal with time. We have to learn how to use it and how to deal with what it throws at us. I don't think I'll ever be fully prepared but hey I've still got time right?</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Ever since I bought a Pure Pro I've sort of been obsessed with the world of mechanical keyboards. As a developer I want to make sure I'm happy typing on something day in day out. It's also very important that I can type fast and accurate so I have to be 100% happy with a keyboard. I've recently sold my Pure Pro which I was pretty happy with as it's just not for me. I bought a Poker 2 ANSI (American layout) as a temporary replacement to it which I've been more than happy with. It currently has <a href="https://ctrlalt.io/buys/raindrop-r2">Raindrop</a> keys on and a Tex acrylic case, it's the nicest keyboard I've ever had the pleasure of typing on.</p>

<p>I've become quite interested in building my own custom keyboard based off the Poker 2 since ISO versions are very very rare these days. I came up with the following layout:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The Drop Layout - can&#39;t wait to build this in a couple of months: <a href="http://t.co/bfjqaTU3CO">pic.twitter.com/bfjqaTU3CO</a></p>&mdash; Mike Bell (@mikebell_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebell_/status/524943339297439745">October 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For the board I've looked into 4 different possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>GH60 - marred by controversy and lack of delivery</li>
<li>Print my own GH60 - only Rev 3 is out and it has a bug so that's a no go</li>
<li>Custom wiring + Teensy 2 - I don't have the skill to pull this off</li>
<li>Nerd60 - pre-soldiered, leds, just add switches!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-nerd-60">The Nerd 60</h1>

<p>I've settled on this PCB as it supports both backlight and side LEDs which will look cool with my Tex case, I just need to wait for it to arrive from Korea when the MOQ has been met.</p>

<p>The controller itself is fully re-programmable and supports lots of different programming layers which is really cool.</p>

<h1 id="the-layout-itself">The layout itself</h1>

<p>I really like 60% keyboards, they're easy to transports and have everything I need to develop on. They fall down with the placement of keys and utilities. That's why I designed this layout.</p>

<p>Here are some key features:
* No Caps lock key, instead it's replaced with an additional Fn key for easy access with your little finger.
* WASD arrow keys, easier access with Caps Fn key.
* Media keys on left hand
* Sane config of utility keys accessible via single right hand or left hand Fn and right hand.
* Mac Layout-ish</p>

<p>I'll be doing a full build log with pictures once I get started, there are still a few decisions I have to make with the keyboard but those are still a way off.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Instead of a long post going into each sessions I attended I figured you're probably just best watching them when they're on YouTube as it was an excellent conference.</p>

<p>So I'd like to quickly run through the things I really enjoyed about the conference and why I'll be attending without fail next year.</p>

<p>The Venue - Surprisingly good tbh, I'm always weary of conference venues but this was pretty cool, especially the pendulum in the main entrance way.</p>

<p>The Talks - Superb as per usual, the keynote from ircmaxell was really good. The standard of talks was super high as has become expected of PHPNW.</p>

<p>The Food - Really good, after lunch I was convinced I wouldn't eat again until much much later in the night but turns out I was starving by tea so the two hot meals was a nice thought.</p>

<p>The Free Bar - This was a very nice touch and very much appreciated. It was great to sit down with so many people in the industry and just chat about random things.</p>

<p>The Un-Con - I was very lucky to be able to present to a smallish (~20) crowd in a nice room. It was well organised and the guys and girls that did were so nice and welcoming.</p>

<p>The Jenny Wong - For those that don't know her (you should go out of way to!) she's an amazing person who does so much for the PHP (and other) communities. It's always a pleasure to meet her and the inevitable drag to people I should meet. She enables so much within the community and is a lovely person.</p>

<p>The End Keynote - These are always weird affairs for me, they usually go on too long (this one did for me) which sucks when everyone is tired and brain dead (the sign of a good conf). Jeremy handed over to the un-con organisers who did a brief run through of the talks they had, they then started to announce that one person would be given a slot at next years conf. It came down to two people and they chose me. It was such an odd experience, I wanted to implode yet I was so happy and amazed. I still can't believe how lucky I am to be speaking at next years conf, it's something that I've wanted to do for a while. I was asked what I'll be presenting on and I think it's only fair to talk about Mental Health again, I have the possibility to reach a much larger crowd on something that is so important. Thank you so much to the whole PHPNW team for deeming me worthy enough.</p>

<p>Here's to next years conf!</p>
