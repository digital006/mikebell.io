            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sent the following email to the CEO of Northern Rail this morning after over a month of frustrating commutes to work.</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>

<p>I’ve recently moved to Swinton in Manchester and I knew in advance that the area was serviced by Northern Rail so my expectations were lower than what I was used to on First Transpennine I wasn’t quite expecting it to be this bad. Here are the examples of things that have happened in the 1 and a half months since i moved:</p>

<ol>
<li>Average daily delay is 10-15 minutes. Mostly in a morning. Me and my partner have come to terms with the fact that the train just won’t be there at the time it says.</li>
<li>Overcrowding, these are busy services I accept this at peak times but not being able to get on the train is not acceptable. One morning I saw a train guard get stuck in the doors as they were closing, it looked painful.</li>
<li>No drivers. This confuses me, how can there be no driver for a train? Sure everyone is human and things go wrong but are there no spare drivers? My offer of driving it myself was turned down though, I suspect this was because I’m a developer.</li>
<li>Train going down the wrong line… let me repeat that train… going… down… the… wrong… line! I didn’t know this was possible. Luckily there wasn’t a collision and we were just delayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is over a small period of time. It’s frustrating beyond belief I want to get to work so I can do my job. If I create bad code then I’m responsible and have to act on it.</p>

<p>Will Northern Rail be improving the service? We need more reliable services, more trains to ease overcrowding and a better service overall.</p>

<p>Regards,
Mike Bell</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm tired, I'm exhausted. I'm mentally fucked.</p>

<p>I had my first "official" appraisal today and I still can't shake the feeling that I've fucked up. That I'm not good enough and everything is my fault.</p>

<p>I'm not even sure it is but at the moment I just feel like I should crawl into a ball and forgot that I exist.</p>

<p>There's one part of the appraisal that has really shocked and upset me. Dependability. My "dependability" is less than satisfactory or some other equally negative wording. I don't really know what to say about that. I feel like I've failed totally. I hope that my friends don't think that.</p>

<p>I'm putting up a front, that I'm fine. The front is breaking and the cracks are showing.</p>

<p>I'm acutely aware of how risky it is putting stuff like this out there. I'm worried that I'll be pulled up at work for things I say here. I'm worried that it'll effect my future employability. I live this half life where I'm constantly worried I'll hurt people and myself yet can pass as a normal human being. I'm sat here watching Hannah clean because we have guests tomorrow and I want to cry. I don't want to hurt those I love. I want to get better but today just seems like a lost cause.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since moving to a new house I have an proper office for the first time so I'm determined to get it right.</p>

<p>I asked on twitter what remote workers would suggest, here are the results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coffee shops as a nice change of scenery - @jjmu15</li>
<li>A recurring theme is good headphones!</li>
<li>A closed door to indicate "do no disturb" - @blakehall</li>
<li>Good music - @jbloomfield</li>
<li>Good coffee (duh!) - @jbloomfield</li>
<li>Comfortable chair - @hussainweb</li>
<li>Good lighting - @lewisnyman @hussainweb</li>
<li>Good mic - @longwave</li>
</ul>

<p>I have most of these already so it's just a case of getting it actually set up.</p>

<p>My keyboard is pretty loud so not sure how that's going to go down!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I fucked up and I fucked up badly.</p>

<p>A few months ago I went cold turkey on propranolol (against all feedback) and after a few weeks the side effects went away and I was fine.</p>

<p>A week ago I decided to stop taking Citalopram cold turkey. This was not a good idea.</p>

<p>Currently I'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms, they're not very nice and they make working and life very difficult.</p>

<p>My symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hazy head</li>
<li>Extreme emotions</li>
<li>Quick to anger</li>
<li>Tension headaches</li>
</ul>

<p>I've learnt my lesson and I'm going back up to 20mg and will sort out tapering off properly.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Today I'm feeling better after going back on them, still a bit hazy and my head aches but I'm a lot better. Don't fuck around with SSRIs</p>

            <link href="/blog/2015/10/13/finite-energy"/>
            <updated>2015-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2015/10/13/finite-energy</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a finite amount of energy. My energy comes in a few different forms, all important to how I feel on a day to day basis.</p>

<p>I find myself applying energy in the wrong place now. Energy that I put in often doesn't yield the results I expect or frankly deserve. I've found myself questioning more of my decisions recently and the outcome of that has been eye opening to me.</p>

<p>At the moment I put my energy in to the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work, coding and process.</li>
<li>House</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Community</li>
</ul>

<p>The energy I put into all these things is something I'm quite proud of considering my situation however I've been slowly changing things.</p>

<p>I'm shifting my energy from work (except coding) because I don't get the results I expect out of it. It's a waste of energy to be involved in process when I enjoy coding so much. This is pretty tough though, I have a lot of pride in what I do, I strive to always do my best, promote coding standards, limit and remove technical debt. All these things I enjoy so much. But I think I'm getting too invested in the project and end product. The energy I put in does not equal the return I get. I spend too much time being worried, nervous and down at how things are going even though I'm doing my best.</p>

<p>Now that I've moved into my new house I need to focus more energy on it, there are so many little things that need doing (which reminds me I need to sort the washing machine out tonight!). The return of energy in my house is enormous being able to come home and crash on my sofa is amazing.</p>

<p>With the new house comes Hannah, she's awesome and deserves me at my best without her I don't think any of this would be worth it.</p>

<p>Community has always been something I love, I want to spend even more time working in it. This comes in two forms. I intend to submit as many CFPs as possible over the next few months and I want to commit even more code to contributed projects. There's a buzz I get from working with the Drupal/PHP community that just can't be beaten.</p>

<p>With the end of this post comes a new caveat to my blog:</p>

<p>Views and opinions represented here are mine and not representative of my employer.</p>

<p>Week 1 - Barcelona
Week 2 - Packing house
Week 3 - PHPNW
Now - Moved in</p>

<p>So lets just recap, I keynoted at Barcelona, packed up my flat, spoke at PHPNW and then moved house the day after.</p>

<p>I'm shattered, mentally and physically now. I've got a few blog posts in draft about both DrupalCon and PHPNW which I'll put out when I get chance. For the time being I have to tether of my phone and I'm loving snuggling on the couch with Hannah so I'm scaling back my online access for a bit.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions I was asked as part of my keynote Q&amp;A was what can we as a community do better at the conference.</p>

<p>My answer came in two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Quiet areas for when we need to get away from the hustle and bustle of the conference.</li>
<li>Coordination with the local (or a world wide) mental health organisation and provide them with space on the exhibition floor.</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand that these two things require extra organisation which is already very difficult considering how busy people are at these conferences but I still think it's a really important thing to do.</p>

<p>I really hope the Drupal Association took note of this and will consider it for upcoming conferences.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WOW where to actually start.</p>

<p>I've been totally blown away by all the discussions and feedback I've had over the past week here in Barcelona, it's been truly amazing and I'm so lucky to have been a part of it.</p>

<h1 id="sunday">Sunday</h1>

<p>I arrived in the evening which sucked a bit. Luckily I bumped into Steve Parks while checking in at the Princess Hotel. He invited me out with a few other Wunders for a "quiet" drink and tapas. This made things a whole lot easier for me since I was pretty nervous about being there on my own.</p>

<h1 id="monday">Monday</h1>

<p>Sprinting was a lot of fun, I made a few contributions to Drupal but mostly used it to catch up with friends.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a long time I wanted to contributed code to Drupal, I have a few times but no where near as much as I thought I was going to do.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about what this really means to me and where my contributions come from. I've only just come to terms with the fact that my contributions don't lie within code but belong in contributing to the community.</p>

<p>Over the next few months I'll be doing a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Working with Adam Hill to make communication in the Drupal UK community a bit easier.</li>
<li>Helping Phil and Eli to grow NWDUG and take pressure off Phil.</li>
<li>Speaking at PHPNW</li>
<li>Other stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>I seem to be quite comfortable doing this so I'll carry on!</p>
