WOW where to actually start.

I've been totally blown away by all the discussions and feedback I've had over the past week here in Barcelona, it's been truly amazing and I'm so lucky to have been a part of it.

#Sunday
I arrived in the evening which sucked a bit. Luckily I bumped into Steve Parks while checking in at the Princess Hotel. He invited me out with a few other Wunders for a "quiet" drink and tapas. This made things a whole lot easier for me since I was pretty nervous about being there on my own.

#Monday
Sprinting was a lot of fun, I made a few contributions to Drupal but mostly used it to catch up with friends.
