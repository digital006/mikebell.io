I've got quite an expensive hobby at the moment - keyboards.

Custom keyboards.

At the moment I have 4 keyboards in my office:

* Poker 2 ISO
* Ducky Shine 3 TKL ISO
* NERD 60
* Winkeyless B.87

In order of purchase here are my collection:

### Ducky Shine 3 TKL ISO (MX Brown)

Basically the above keyboard but without the numberpad. This is my longest serving board and up until a few weeks ago was in active service. It's now waiting to be cleaned and pieced back together before I hand it over to my Dad.

Overall I'm really pleased with this board, it's solid and well built, the keycaps are a bit crap but I replaced those with Raindrop (pictures further down). The LEDs on my board were fine considering Ducky had quite a few quality control issues down the line.

It has some neet features, including different LED modes (mine was the white edition), gimmicky but I liked them.

### KBT Pure Pro 60% (MX Brown) (SOLD)

It's a bit of a hybrid monster, a 60% but with a arrow keys, the none standard layout made it really difficult to use and in the end I sold it to a friend. I quickly learnt that having short shifts was really annoying.

### Poker 2 ISO (MX Brown)

I learnt my lessons with the Pro so grabbed a Poker 2, overall a solid board but the function key and arrow combition made my fingers hurt after a while so it got retired pretty quickly. The keycaps on this board are PBT which are amazing, they have a really satisfying clack to them. Plus my version was white so they looked quite different to most boards.

### NERD 60 (Gateron Brown)

This was my first foray into custom building. It's [GON](http://http://www.gonskeyboardworks.com/) NERD 60 shipped all the way from Korea. The PCB was pre-soldiered making things a lot easier I just had to install the Gateron Brown switches and flash the firmware.

The custom firmware made things a lot easier, having configurable layers meant that I could map CAPS to FN so I could operate the arrow keys bound to WASD with one hand.

This was the first board with LED backlighting, I have it disabled by default because I damanged one of the surface mount LEDs so it flickers which is really annoying, it's a shame because the case is frosted acrylic so the shine-through was quite nice.

Since sourcing Cherry MX Browns is pretty much impossible I opted for Gateron Browns which are a slightly more resistant (higher actuation) clone. They're nice switches and relatively cheap.

The stabalisers are Cherry which are frankly appaling, it's like pressing mushy plastic. I really wish I'd modded them before adding them to the board.

Overall this board (without keycaps) cost me around £250. I have a small build log [here](http://imgur.com/a/MpVvI).

### Winkeyless B.87 (Gateron Brown)

This is my latest and greatest creation and my current daily driver. I considered this end game for me (for about a week or so). I bought the parts (fully soldiered) form [Winkeyless](http://winkeyless.kr/) another Korean company (they love custom keyboards!).

Again I opted for Gateron Browns since I've grown quite attached to them and they're cheap.

This keyboard has white in switch LEDs with RGB backlighting. The case is frosted acrylic so the lights shine through really well.

One of my main issues with this board is the same as the NERD60 the stabalisers are horrible, my backspace key squeeks which is horrible!

This board also has customisable firmware, it's a bit harder to use than the NERD60s since the instructions are in Korean and uses the column/row notation for keymapping.
