Processes and standards are key to a successful project in anything. This ranges from personal projects to large corporate projects.

I have a problem with standards though, they assume everything is equal. This is a bit of a brain dump and I don't have the right answers (there aren't any) it's more of a thought experiment.

#Tools
I built drupaldev-apache/nginx because I wanted something to give back to the Drupal community and it was useful to my daily work/personal development process. Both these tools have been superseded badger
