Since moving to a new house I have an proper office for the first time so I'm determined to get it right.

I asked on twitter what remote workers would suggest, here are the results:

* Coffee shops as a nice change of scenery - @jjmu15
* A recurring theme is good headphones!
* A closed door to indicate "do no disturb" - @blakehall
* Good music - @jbloomfield
* Good coffee (duh!) - @jbloomfield
* Comfortable chair - @hussainweb
* Good lighting - @lewisnyman @hussainweb
* Good mic - @longwave

I have most of these already so it's just a case of getting it actually set up.

My keyboard is pretty loud so not sure how that's going to go down!
