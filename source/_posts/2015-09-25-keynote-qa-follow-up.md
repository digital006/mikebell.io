One of the questions I was asked as part of my keynote Q&A was what can we as a community do better at the conference.

My answer came in two parts:

1. Quiet areas for when we need to get away from the hustle and bustle of the conference.
2. Coordination with the local (or a world wide) mental health organisation and provide them with space on the exhibition floor.

I understand that these two things require extra organisation which is already very difficult considering how busy people are at these conferences but I still think it's a really important thing to do.

I really hope the Drupal Association took note of this and will consider it for upcoming conferences.
