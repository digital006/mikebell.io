It's no secret that I'm looking at organising DrupalCamp NW 2017, it's something that's been at the back of my mind for a few years now and with the uncon safely behind me I think I have the confidence I need to get started. There's one thing holding me back though.

> I want to do diversity well.

I hope that doesn't come across patronising or idiotic, I genuinely want to build something amazing for the community. I feel I need to explain something first though, I'm not articulate enough to talk about diversity in public, my brain just can't keep up with the flow of conversation and contribute in a fashion that I feel is meaningful. That's not to say I don't have a voice, given time I can sit down and write articulate things. I'm just afraid that I'll say something stupid and upset people, that's never my intention but lets face it 140 characters just isn't enough most times.

So with that out of the way I have some plans and this is where you come in! I need help, I need people to guide me:

* Blind CFP -  All we see is the session title and abstract.
* Speaker Recommendation - A form for people to recommend people we can reach out to.
* Person/People for outreach - A person or team of people reaching out to people for submissions.
* Diversity Grants - Company sponsored grants for tickets/travel/accommodation.

My question to you, what else should I be doing to make sure that we have a diverse Drupal Camp? The above list is just a start but I feel it's a healthy one and something that we can build on.

Please feel free to leave a comment below or contact me through twitter (@mikebell_) or email (hello@mikebell.io) I'd love to hear your ideas.
