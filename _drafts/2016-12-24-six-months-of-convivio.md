To say I've grown up over the past 6 months would be quite an understatement. The past 6 months have been some of the hardest, intense, rewarding and enjoyable times of my life.

The actual anniversary of the company founding passed me by, I was too busy with client work that it didn't really register. This meant I didn't really have a proper chance to digest and reflect on what we've done and accomplished.

Convivio was born out of the need to do things right and well, to take pride and ownership in the work we produce and just do good things. We want our work to reach millions of people and have positive impact on the people that use what we build.

The Convivio name reflects this, it's the idea of a gathering, sharing good food and conversation. The entire Convivio spirit was summed up this year when Joe Baker invited all of us to his house for Christmas dinner, 16 of us all sat around a table sharing stories and eating food we'd all made together over the past few days. It was quite heartbreaking leaving Birmingham on that Sunday.

I'm not just a developer anymore, I'm a sysadmin, solutions architect, colleague and friend. Where I am on a personal level is a million miles away from where I was a year ago. My business and personal priorities have changed, Convivio has made me grow as a person.
