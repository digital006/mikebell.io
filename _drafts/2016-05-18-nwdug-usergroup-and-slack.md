Around the 9th of September 2015 we set up Slack for NWDUG. Before the slack channel communication wasn't brilliant, it felt to me like our community was just centred around one day a month event.

We toyed with the idea of an IRC channel for a bit but the user onboarding was too much and the lack of moderation tools and integrations was a real deal killer for me. So we settled on Slack and then ran with it.
