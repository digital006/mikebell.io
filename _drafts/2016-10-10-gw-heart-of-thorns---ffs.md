I finally got round to finishing Sword Art Online and had a hankering for an MMO. WoW is out since I burned myself out on that years ago. I've played around 2-3k hours of the original Guild Wars and loved it, it's the reason why I don't have an honours degree! I already had GW2 as well since I picked it up on launch and played around 400 hours of it. So in theory Heart of Thrones expansion was a no brainer, it's the latest paid expansion to GW2 and sites between Living Story 2 and 3.

I like the updates that they've made to the core game it certainly feels a lot nicer but HoT is just a hot pile of disappointment.

##Â Empty Areas slow/stop progression

HoT was probably awesome when it first came out, lots of people around to help with objectives. Now the starting areas are a wasteland with only a few people around for the meta events. I'm slowly learning the event rotations but some are just impossible without 10+ people.

## Experience gates campaign

Holy crap was this annoying, I was making progress through the campaign and then all of a sudden I was stopped by the fact I didn't have enough exp in gliding to continue, it took around 4 hours to get that experience and then continue. Maybe I'm missing something but it really broke the campaign for me, I wanted to progress and explore more not grind out the starting area.

## Confusing map and gliding

This is heavily linked to the last section, there are lots of mechanics in HoT that require you grinding out masteries to unlock them. Super frustrating when your trying to get to an event to get more XP. Would it kill for a few more waypoints in the HoT maps as well? I spent 10 minutes running to a quest location only to get stomped on by a veteren that chain stunned me into oblivion, I died just in eyesight of the waypoint.

I want to like this game I really do, there are good parts to it! It still looks stunning, the re-worked legendaries is awesome and I'm working my way towards Twilight and I'm going to start another legendary at some point. It still feels like it's not geared around casuals, there's so much grinding to get masteries it's just annoying. I don't like having content locked behind these XP grinds. With events you can't complete at lower mastery levels and a campaign that looks great but is locked again by masteries it's proving to be annoying. I hope I'm missing some key part of the game, something that will become clear and make my experience that much better.
