Well this exploded, I've been having issues with my internet for 5 days, often the connection just drops and refuses to come back up. I decided I'd get in contact with Plusnet to try and sort it out. At first I wanted to create a support ticket but it turns out they've turned that off now, I wasn't in any state to talk to someone since I've got a chest infection so the next best thing was live chat. Queue Phil W. After giving Phil my landline number he asked me to confirm the first and last letters of my password, odd. I queried him as to wether he had access to my full password which he did. Well fuck that.

So lets get this straight, Plusnet support agents have full access to your password in plaintext...

But it's ok:

Wait no it's fucking not!

Here's Plusnet going on the defencive again:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/GravzyIT">@GravzyIT</a> Sorry, but there&#39;s little more we can add.

@GravzyIT hits the nail right on the head here. But it's ok because Plusnet trust their agents blindly not to abuse their power. Because no one ever would...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/mikebell_">@mikebell_</a> It *is* as bad as it sounds. I was a support drone once upon a time. We had full account &amp; pwd access. Untoward things happened.</p>&mdash; Joeri Poesen (@jpoesen) <a href="https://twitter.com/jpoesen/status/727851305042055168">May 4, 2016</a></blockquote>

So where's the problem? Well to start with this issue has been known about since the dawn of time - https://community.plus.net/t5/My-Account-Billing/Why-does-Plusnet-store-my-account-password-in-plain-text/td-p/918205 - 2012 - Seriously it's a known issue but apparently it's fine. Urgh it's frustrating, If I ever implemented anything like this at work I'd be fired.

The second issue is Plusnet staff seem to think that this is ok. It's blind ignorance to think that it is. We live in an age where our digital identity is as important as our passport, bank account details and other hard copy data.

So Plusnet what do I want you to do? For me nothing, I'm leaving as soon as possible after years of service you've lost my trust completely. For others I want you to change I want you to rebuild your systems so that your support agents don't have access to personal data in such a ridiculous.

Ultimately I want you to do your customers proud.
